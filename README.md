- 👋 Hi, I’m @meet-z
- 👀 I’m interested in way to many things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for my CS degree (started with HTML and JavaScript a while ago, now focussed on understanding Java and Python).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (nothing yet, as I am still fairly new to the field)
- 📫 How to reach me: here I guess? ;)
