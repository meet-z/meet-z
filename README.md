- 👋 Hi, I’m @meet-z
- 👀 I’m interested in way to many things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for my CS degree (started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java a while ago, now trying to find out, what field I want to dive into further).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (nothing yet, as I am still trying to figure out, how all of this works!)
- 📫 How to reach me: here I guess? :)
